## Note to Students

For _this and all future assignments_, you will now have to code your markdown
file in addition to the `main.R` functions. The `report.Rmd` file still has the
same background and assignment information included and the R code blocks are
created, just like in previous assignments, but from now on they will devoid of
code.

Don't worry, there are instructions in `report.Rmd` to guide you through the
code blocks!
